  Every year, new students from all over the world are recruited as digital ambassadors and bloggers for Study In Sweden - an official resource curated by Swedish Institute to promote Sweden as a higher education destination worldwide. This year, the new ambassadors were welcomed by an improved blog design that we had the pleasure to create.

section1: |
  In the first stage of the project, we did research by analyzing the current user interaction with the blog as well as surveying current bloggers and readers of the site. Essential head start was provided by insights from our strategist Edīte who was a digital ambassador for Study In Sweden in 2016/17.

  Although the project was of a rather small scale, we put a lot of effort in combining the insights from the research, current bloggers, as well as the goals set by the client in our wireframes. As a result, we came up with a design that highlighted the importance of giving the visitor the most relevant information and an incentive to continue reading for longer. We did this while keeping the individuality of each blogger and praise in their work of high importance.

  ## The design
  The new design addresses the importance on high quality, editorial images and content that is structured for easier navigation. It focuses on better reading experience as well as promoting and integrating the rest of Study In Sweden site in the user journey.

  During the project we worked closely together with the client as well as the agency Fröjd who developed the blog. Soon after the launch we conducted a workshop together with the new ambassadors to make sure that the new guidelines were understood and implemented.
