  Every year, new students from all over the world are recruited as digital ambassadors and bloggers for Study In Sweden - a website that promotes Sweden as study destination worldwide. Redesigning a site that promotes a country - that was clearly a job for the ones obsessed with Swedishness and user experience at Fully Studios.

  At first, it was almost unfair - Edīte, the manager for the project, was a digital ambassador at Study In Sweden herself just a year ago. Having this kind of head start into research was great, but even better was the input from the current bloggers and readers that helped in research. It turns out, when a country's image is at stake, people join forces to advise. We took the full advantage of it and thank everyone who participated.

  Some might brush this off by saying it's a short, simple re-design project, but combining insights from the stakeholders, previous user research and user interviews thoroughly was crucial for us. After all, we had to come up with solutions for making visitors engage with the site for longer and hopefully - help to convince them that Sweden is the perfect place to move to for their next degree. If you've ever tried convincing your parents to support any crazy ideas of yours - you know what kind of power we were dealing with.

  ## The design
  The aim was to give more exposure to the bloggers and their own content and be smarter about how to provide the most relevant content to the reader through seamless navigation. As all the great things about Sweden, we learnt that simplicity is what matters. We made it easier to read, search and get inspired to start the next life chapter in Sweden.

  We got to meet new friends along the way through working together with digital agency Fröjd who developed the blog and Edīte got to go back to the digital ambassador team. This time, not to write, but to lead a workshop on how to create content that will shine with the help of new redesign. Looks like a full circle to us!
