## Ode, owed?
Owd Bob was created entirely in the Fully lab. We wanted to experiment with speed bumps on the web, and test the general truth that the web is always open. What if it’s not? What if a web store has opening hours? How will that affect traffic, and sales. The name came from an old childrens book from the late 19th century. The title is in Cumbrian dialect and actually means Old Bob. And making the title pretty much impossible to understand is a quite daring speed bump in our opinion. Hats of to the author, Alfred Ollivant.

Anyway. The Owd Bob store is basically a print store that is open for 48 hours hours at a time. During this period we sell an art print by an carefully selected artist. We only present one artist at a time. The number of copies that is sold during the time limit gets signed numbered and printed. The store simply offers time limited editions of wall art.

## Art moves mountains and letters
We wanted the visual identity to make an graphic statement. Playful and organic. We thought that lettering was the way to go. More specific; motion lettering. As a way to simulate the creative process of the artist.  

## Mona Lisa used to smile	
To establish the fact that we don’t crate the art itself we used a picture of the Mona Lisa on the landing page. And we put our logo on her face, sorry about that. We did this for two reasons. 1. The artwork is secret until the stores open. 2. We had to show people that it is in fact an art store.

## Secret clubhouse
When it came to marketing, we didn’t go for range – we aimed at exclusivity. We started off, only using Instagram. And mainly promote the artist in our posts. This way we could focus on varied, quality content. We also only wanted to follow interesting artists, not people likely to follow us back, figuring that more followers could lower the sense of exclusivity. Every follower should be someone interested in art, not interested in getting followers of their own. 

The opening hours was also revealed on Instagram only. If you missed it, you needed to go back and check. Otherwise the opportunity is gone. And the store is closed again. We hope this would get people to actively visit our profile. And hopefully see the opening as an event.

Our plan worked. We gained a lot of interest and got contacted by several journalists who wanted to write about the project. For instance, My clever Lab named us Startup of the week. And the artists told us that they have sold more prints during the 48 hours than they had in a year when featured on some of the print on demand alternatives out there.

## Alive and growing
The Owd Bob store is constantly evolving. We always look at new possibilities to present and sell the prints. And new ways to market the site. At the same time. Fully is steadily improving and finding new tools in how to market on the web, with an extremely low budget.
