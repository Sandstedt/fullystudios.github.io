  TanumStrand is a hotel and retreat center on Sweden’s west coast, close-ish to the Norwegian border. With its granite archipelagos, misty mornings and gently rocking rowboats, it’s an idyll that would make any Swedish ex-pat weep.

  ### Recently TanumStrand gave itself a facelift. They updated their spa and revitalized their restaurant, and even overhauled their website.
  In this season of transformation, they wanted us to produce a few commercials to spotlight their fresh new look and set the tone as a place of rest and rejuvenation.
  
  Rather than focus on advertising their new facilities, I wanted to create an immersive experience that would stir longing in the viewer. In other words: we weren’t going to sell the spa. We were going to sell the peace. 

  We ended up doing 4 films in total -- Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter -- with each focusing on the festive hallmarks of the season. These mini narratives of tranquility performed exceptionally well as commercials, and aired as a 15 second spot on TV 4 and a 20 second spot on the web.

  ## Spring
  
  We began with Spring, a season when the earth is shaking itself out of its slumber, and people are doing the same. TanumStrand had renovated their gym so I wanted to point in that direction, but have the mood be more expansive and peaceful. Hence the outdoor training scenes.
