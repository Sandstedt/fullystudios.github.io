  Kakservice has been around since the 70’s. In their early days they sold cinnamon buns and newspapers to sailors in the Fjällbacka archipelago. Today their cookies go to schools, sport clubs and organisations, where they are then sold to help raise funds for special causes and programs.
  
  Kakservice came to us and wanted to make an instructional animated film that explains and supports the sales process.

  When you make this kind of film, or any film, you start out with a storyboard. It’s drawn in a simplified style, but in a way that communicates the essence of the film. In this case, the entire film was drawn by hand (but, you know, in digital files). Then came After Effects for animation, sound and final polish.
